# Physics Based Game Mechanics 

## Why? 
Have you ever had an awesome game idea you couldn't pursue because you didn't know the math behind the game mechanic? 
This repository hopes to reduce this problem by providing examples of how to recreate various game mechanics using a variety of tools. 

## Contributing 
Please try to keep your examples as minimal as possible. 

### Mechanics Requests 
If there's a mechanic you're not sure how to implement, please post it as an issue, and hopefully someone can provide a potential implementation example, please do not mention a specific technology in the title of your issue, but if there is a preferred technology, then mention that in the issue's comment. 

### Include a README 
Please include a README, see the template.md, there's no need to include live demos of the mechanic, but if you want, include this in the example usage as a link.
