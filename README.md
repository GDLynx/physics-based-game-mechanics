# Physics Based Game Mechanics 

## Why? 
Have you ever had an awesome game idea you couldn't pursue because you didn't know the math behind a game mechanic? 
This repository hopes to reduce this problem by providing examples of how to recreate various game mechanics using a variety of tools. 

## Contributing 
Please try to keep your examples as minimal as possible. 

### Mechanics Requests 
If there's a mechanic you're not sure how to implement, please post it as an issue, and hopefully someone can provide a potential implementation example, please do not mention a specific technology in the title of your issue, but if there is a preferred technology, then mention that in the issue's comment. 

### Include a README 
Please include a README, see the template.md, there's no need to include live demos of the mechanic, but if you want, include this in the example usage as a link.
